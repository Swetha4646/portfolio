                   <h2>My Journey into Frontend Web Development: From Curiosity to Code</h2>
                   <p>
                      Like many aspiring developers, my journey began with simple curiosity. I was fascinated by how websites looked and functioned,
                      and I found myself wondering how each button, color, and animation came to life. That curiosity led me to explore the basics 
                      of web development—starting with HTML and CSS. With each new concept I learned, I became more eager to create and experiment.
                      From building my first static page to adding interactive features with JavaScript, every step felt rewarding. This blog is a 
                      reflection of that journey—a space where I share my experiences, growth, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.

                   <h2>Taking the First Step with HTML and CSS</h2>
                   <p>
                       My first real dive into frontend development started with learning HTML and CSS. At first, it felt overwhelming—tags, attributes, 
                       selectors—but soon I realized how powerful these tools are. I started building basic layouts like a personal bio page and simple 
                       landing pages. It was incredibly satisfying to see the structure of a webpage come together with HTML and then bring it to life
                       using CSS. Understanding the box model, positioning elements, and playing with colors and fonts gave me a sense of creativity
                       and control. These first steps helped me build a strong foundation and boosted my confidence to move forward.

                   <h2>Adding Interactivity with JavaScript</h2>
                   <p>
                       Once I was comfortable with HTML and CSS, I felt ready to make my websites do more than just sit there. That’s when I started learning 
                       JavaScript. It opened a whole new world of interactivity—buttons that responded to clicks, forms that could validate user input, and pages 
                       that reacted dynamically without reloading. My first JavaScript project was a simple to-do list, and seeing it actually work felt amazing. 
                       Although the syntax was tricky at first, the logic behind it excited me. JavaScript made me realize that I wasn’t just designing websites—I 
                       was building experiences.
